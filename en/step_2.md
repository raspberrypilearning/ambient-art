title: Design using squared or plain paper
---

If you don't have access to a printer then you can use squared (graph) paper or plain paper to create your design.

+ For each frame, draw an 8 x 8 grid on your paper.

+ Select a minimum of two coloured pencils or felt tip pens to colour in your frames. 

**Tip**: Make sure that you use colours from the colour palette!
